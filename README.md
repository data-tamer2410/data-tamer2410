#### **Project Experience**

- [**Sentiment Analysis with RNN**](https://github.com/data-tamer2410/ds-sentiment-analysis-with-rnn)

  **Tech Stack**: Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib, SciKit-Learn.

  In this project, I developed a set of deep learning models to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as positive or negative. Leveraging the sequential nature of text data, I 
  implemented and compared multiple recurrent neural network architectures, including Simple RNN, LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM (BRNN), and Deep Bidirectional LSTM (DBRNN). The dataset 
  contains 50,000 reviews, split evenly into training and testing subsets. Each model was trained to capture contextual information and sentiment patterns from the text, and their 
  performance was evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics. The best results were achieved by the Bidirectional LSTM model, demonstrating its ability to handle complex text data 
  effectively.

  **Key Achievements**:
  - **Advanced Architectures**: Explored and implemented multiple RNN-based architectures to improve text classification performance.  
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Managed data padding and tokenization to prepare text data for recurrent models.  
  - **Model Evaluation**: Visualized training and validation results, analyzing differences in model performance across architectures.

- [**Fashion MNIST Classifier 2.0**](https://github.com/data-tamer2410/ds-fashion-mnist-classifier-2.0)

  **Tech Stack**: Keras, SciKit-Learn, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Streamlit, Docker.
   
  This project explores advanced techniques for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset, where I implemented multiple neural network architectures to enhance accuracy. The  
  task involved classifying images of various clothing items based on grayscale data, using methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), VGG16 for feature extraction, and fine-  
  tuning pre-trained models for better performance. As part of this project, I developed an interactive web dashboard to visualize model predictions and provide insights into the 
  dataset [Dashboard](https://ds-fashion-mnist-classifier-2-0.onrender.com). 

  **Key Achievements**:
  - **Multiple Model Approaches:** Developed custom CNN, utilized VGG16 for feature extraction, and fine-tuned VGG16 layers to maximize classification accuracy.  
  - **Previous Work Integration:** Built on a previous project where I created a simpler fully connected classifier for the Fashion MNIST dataset.  
  - **Real-World Impact:** Demonstrated the potential for using these techniques in practical applications like retail and fashion e-commerce. 

- [**Eyes Classification**](https://github.com/data-tamer2410/ds-eyes-classification)

  **Tech Stack**: Keras, SciKit-Learn, Numpy, Matplotlib.
   
  In this project, I developed a deep learning model for classifying images of eyes into different categories (open or closed). The dataset consists of various images of human eyes 
  captured in real-life conditions. The model was built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and trained to recognize subtle features of the eye, providing a robust classification 
  solution that can be used in applications such as facial recognition or eye-tracking systems.

  **Key Achievements**:
  - **Deep Learning Architecture**: Implemented CNNs for efficient feature extraction and classification of images.
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Applied data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's generalization ability.
  - **Real-World Use Cases**: The model can be used for real-time applications such as eye health monitoring, security, and accessibility technologies.

- [**Handwritten Digit Recognition**](https://github.com/data-tamer2410/ds-handwritten-digit-recognition)

  **Tech Stack**: TensorFlow, Keras, SciKit-Learn, Numpy, Matplotlib.

  In this project, I developed a neural network model to accurately recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The architecture features two hidden layers with sigmoid   
  activation functions and a softmax output layer for multi-class classification.  

  **Key Achievements**:
  - **High Accuracy**: Achieved 92.40% accuracy on training data and approximately 89.87% in cross-validation.
  - **Data Processing**: Implemented effective data normalization and transformation techniques to optimize model performance.
  - **Evaluation Metrics**: Used precision, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model effectiveness, demonstrating its ability to reliably distinguish between digits. 

- [**Accelerometer Activity Classification**](https://github.com/data-tamer2410/ds-accelerometer-activity-classification)

  **Tech Stack**: SciKit-Learn, Optuna, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

  In this project, I developed a human activity recognition system that accurately classifies activities such as idle, running, walking, and climbing stairs using accelerometer data. 
  Leveraging machine learning algorithms, including k-NN and Random Forest, I implemented a pipeline for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation. The project 
  demonstrates my ability to apply advanced analytics to real-world problems and highlights my skills in data science, machine learning, and software development. The high accuracy 
  achieved not only showcases the effectiveness of the models used but also emphasizes the potential for real-time applications in health monitoring and smart device integration.
