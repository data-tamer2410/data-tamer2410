<h3 align="center">Project Experience</h3>

- üöÄ [**Doctor Chat ‚Äì AI Assistant for Medical Consultations**](https://github.com/data-tamer2410/ds-doctor-chat)

  **Tech Stack**: TensorFlow, Transformers, Docker, Sreamlit, Pandas.

  In this project, I developed an AI-powered chatbot that provides medical advice and recommendations. The bot utilizes a fine-tuned GPT-2 model to generate responses in a structured 
  dialogue format between the patient and a virtual doctor. The application is built using Streamlit and deployed on a server, ensuring seamless accessibility. The chatbot offers 
  personalized health advice, making it an essential tool for quick consultations and initial diagnostics.

  **Key Achievements**:  
  - **AI-Powered Chatbot with High Accuracy**: Fine-tuned the GPT-2 model to achieve high accuracy in generating medical advice, reducing perplexity to **12.91**.  
  - **Optimized Responses for Medical Domain**: Implemented a rigorous fine-tuning process to tailor the responses specifically to the medical domain, ensuring that the chatbot provides 
  accurate, reliable, and contextually appropriate answers.  
  - **User-Friendly Interface**: Built an intuitive and engaging front-end with Streamlit, allowing users to interact easily with the bot and receive personalized advice.  
  - **Scalable and Efficient Deployment**: Deployed the solution in a Docker container, ensuring scalability, easy deployment, and enhanced performance across different environments.

- ‚òÄÔ∏è [**Weather Forecast API**](https://github.com/data-tamer2410/ds-weather-forecast)

  **Tech Stack**: Keras, FastAPI, Docker, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib.

  In this project, I developed an RNN-based API to forecast weather conditions for the next day using historical data from the past 7 days. The model was trained on multiple weather 
  features such as temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, providing precise predictions for parameters like maximum and minimum temperature, rainfall probability, 
  and wind gust speed. The API was containerized using Docker and deployed on a server, enabling seamless integration and scalability. The endpoint is easily accessible via POST 
  requests, making it practical for real-world applications in weather monitoring or decision support systems.

  **Key Achievements**:  
  - **Deep Learning Integration**: Designed and deployed an RNN model optimized for time-series weather data prediction.  
  - **API Development and Deployment**: Built a FastAPI backend, packaged it in Docker, and deployed it on Render.  
  - **Efficient Predictions**: Developed an interface that accepts 7 days of weather data and returns precise forecasts, including the probability of rainfall.  
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Implemented scaling and reshaping mechanisms to prepare complex weather datasets for accurate model inference.  

- üé¨ [**Sentiment Analysis with RNN**](https://github.com/data-tamer2410/ds-sentiment-analysis-with-rnn)

  **Tech Stack**: Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn.

  In this project, I developed a set of deep learning models to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as positive or negative. Leveraging the sequential nature of text data, I 
  implemented and compared multiple recurrent neural network architectures, including Simple RNN, LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM (BRNN), and Deep Bidirectional LSTM (DBRNN). The dataset 
  contains 50,000 reviews, split evenly into training and testing subsets. Each model was trained to capture contextual information and sentiment patterns from the text, and their 
  performance was evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics. The best results were achieved by the Bidirectional LSTM model, demonstrating its ability to handle complex text data 
  effectively.

  **Key Achievements**:
  - **Advanced Architectures**: Explored and implemented multiple RNN-based architectures to improve text classification performance.  
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Managed data padding and tokenization to prepare text data for recurrent models.  
  - **Model Evaluation**: Visualized training and validation results, analyzing differences in model performance across architectures.

- üëï [**Fashion MNIST Classifier 2.0**](https://github.com/data-tamer2410/ds-fashion-mnist-classifier-2.0)

  **Tech Stack**: Keras, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Streamlit, Docker.
   
  This project explores advanced techniques for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset, where I implemented multiple neural network architectures to enhance accuracy. The  
  task involved classifying images of various clothing items based on grayscale data, using methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), VGG16 for feature extraction, and fine-  
  tuning pre-trained models for better performance. As part of this project, I developed an interactive web dashboard to visualize model predictions and provide insights into the 
  dataset. 

  **Interactive Web Dashboard**: https://ds-fashion-mnist-classifier-2-0.onrender.com
  
  **Key Achievements**:
  - **Multiple Model Approaches**: Developed custom CNN, utilized VGG16 for feature extraction, and fine-tuned VGG16 layers to maximize classification accuracy.  
  - **Previous Work Integration**: Built on a previous project where I created a simpler fully connected classifier for the Fashion MNIST dataset.  
  - **Real-World Impact**: Demonstrated the potential for using these techniques in practical applications like retail and fashion e-commerce.
