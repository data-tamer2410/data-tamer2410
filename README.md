#### **Project Highlights**

1. **Sentiment Analysis with RNN**  
  In this project, I developed a set of deep learning models to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as positive or negative. Leveraging the sequential nature of text data, I 
  implemented and compared multiple recurrent neural network architectures, including Simple RNN, LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM (BRNN), and Deep Bidirectional LSTM (DBRNN). The dataset 
  contains 50,000 reviews, split evenly into training and testing subsets. Each model was trained to capture contextual information and sentiment patterns from the text, and their 
  performance was evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics. The best results were achieved by the Bidirectional LSTM model, demonstrating its ability to handle complex text data 
  effectively.
  - *Technologies*: Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib, SciKit-Learn

2. **Fashion MNIST Classifier 2.0**  
  This project explores advanced techniques for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset, where I implemented multiple neural network architectures to enhance accuracy. The   
  task involved classifying images of various clothing items based on grayscale data, using methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), VGG16 for feature extraction, and fine-  
  tuning pre-trained models for better performance.
  - *Technologies*: Keras, SciKit-Learn, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Streamlit

3. **Eyes Classification**  
  In this project, I developed a deep learning model for classifying images of eyes into different categories (open or closed). The dataset consists of various images of human eyes 
  captured in real-life conditions. The model was built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and trained to recognize subtle features of the eye, providing a robust classification 
  solution that can be used in applications such as facial recognition or eye-tracking systems.  
  - *Technologies*: Keras, SciKit-Learn, Numpy, Matplotlib

4. **Handwritten Digit Recognition**  
  In this project, I developed a neural network model to accurately recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The architecture features two hidden layers with sigmoid   
  activation functions and a softmax output layer for multi-class classification.  
  - *Technologies*: TensorFlow, Keras, SciKit-Learn, Numpy, Matplotlib  

5. **Accelerometer Activity Classification**  
  In this project, I developed a human activity recognition system that accurately classifies activities such as idle, running, walking, and climbing stairs using accelerometer data. 
  Leveraging machine learning algorithms, including k-NN and Random Forest, I implemented a pipeline for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation. The project 
  demonstrates my ability to apply advanced analytics to real-world problems and highlights my skills in data science, machine learning, and software development. The high accuracy 
  achieved not only showcases the effectiveness of the models used but also emphasizes the potential for real-time applications in health monitoring and smart device integration.
